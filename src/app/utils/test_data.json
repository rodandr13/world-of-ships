Ryūjō participated in the Sino-Japanese War from 1937 through 1939. During World War II, the aircraft carrier supported landings in the Philippines, covered convoys headed to the Dutch East Indies, and participated in raids in the Indian Ocean and around the Aleutian Islands.",

USS Ranger carried an air group that was only slightly inferior in number to the air groups of her larger predecessors. Ranger continued her service until the end of the war in the Atlantic. She escorted the first Arctic convoys from America to Iceland and was subsequently used as an aircraft transport, facilitating the deployment of army units landing in Africa.",

Such a design allowed for a fully enclosed hangar space. At the time when the Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor, USS Lexington was in the process of transferring planes to Midway. During the Battle of the Coral Sea, USS Lexington sustained several bomb hits. Eventually, the decision was taken to scuttle the ship, and destroyer USS Phelps was tasked with sinking Lexington using torpedoes.",

When she was commissioned into the navy in October 1939, three single-gun 130 mm B-13 gun mounts were placed on the ship as temporary weapons.

A requirement was also formed to increase the number of dual-purpose guns to 12 and investigate the possibility of replacing them with eight 130 mm coupled mounts.

In March 1933, AG Vulcan Stettin released a design proposal for a \"conventional London Naval Treaty\" destroyer featuring a displacement of 1,500 tons. Later, the project underwent revisions, resulting in an increased displacement of 2,000 tons. Nevertheless, the Kriegsmarine leadership favored an alternative project, which served as the basis for the subsequent development of the Type 1934 ships.",

Upon reaching their designated age limits, these vessels could be replaced with ships weighing no more than 10,000 tons in displacement. In the 1920s, the heads of the Navy initiated extensive research into future ships to replace the old battleships. Several variants were proposed, including a design resembling the \"Washington\" cruisers. This particular project envisioned the use of eight 8-inch guns. The project was never implemented, but its further development led to the emergence of \"pocket battleships.\"",

In autumn 1944, the battleship was struck twice by 6-ton bombs that almost incapacitated her, and then she was ultimately sunk by British Lancaster-type bombers.",

Back in 1923, he published an essay that described the general features of cruisers of the future. In 1926, he presented three cruiser projects to the Royal Navy—projects A and B resembled the County-class cruisers, while project C turned out to be more radical. It envisaged the arrangement of main battery turrets at the bow to achieve a better concentration of fire. The Admiralty, however, assumed a more conservative approach than Thurston, and the project was left without consideration.",

However, the U.S. aircraft carriers' operating experience showed that it's necessary to warm up aircraft engines in the hangar to carry out a massive launch of the air group. The choice fell on a project with an open hangar and two aircraft lifts on the port side. All works were stopped with the end of World War II.",

The dual-purpose secondary battery was represented by mounts with 100 mm guns. Such a cruiser would have been a direct analog of the Town-class British cruisers or the Soviet cruisers of Project 68.",

The project was developed by Mitsubishi. Kaibōkan No. 40 was built at the Fujinagata shipyard. After the surrender of Japan, the ship was used in the fleets of the Anti-Hitler coalition countries as a minesweeper, and in the August of 1947, she was transferred to the Chinese fleet and renamed Chengan.

        "description": "After World War I, the Italian armored cruisers, built at the beginning of the 20th century, became inadequate for the tasks at hand. Therefore, after determining the requirements of the Washington Naval Conference, the design of a new cruiser began. Two ships with high speed and 70 mm armor belts formed the Trento class. The lead cruiser was laid down in 1925. At the beginning of World War II, she saw action at Punta Stilo, Cape Teulada, and Cape Matapan. In all of her battles, Trento neither caused any damage to the enemy nor received any.",

Further development in 1929 resulted in two ships of an improved design being laid down—Klas Horn and Klas Uggla. The lead ship of the Klas Horn series was built at the Kockums shipyard in Malmö. In September 1941, due to an explosion at a military base, both destroyers suffered significant damage and sank. Klas Uggla was not restored and was decommissioned, while Klas Horn was raised and repaired using parts from her sister ship.",

Öland and Uppland were built according to a compromise project incorporating two of the latest main battery mounts designed for maximum rate of fire. The project turned out to be a success, although a belated one.

An alternative solution could be the other approach, which envisaged ordering a pair of large ships with 140 mm guns. The most suitable was one of the pre-designs of a fleet cruiser that the British Admiralty was considering at that time. Namely, the E-class cruiser armed with six 140 mm guns.

The Mogador-class destroyers were suitable for the purpose as they were comparable to light cruisers in certain parameters and outmatched them in others (for example, in speed).

Her main caliber was presented with 150 mm guns, and a thin layered armor scheme provided effective protection from shells. In September 1939, the ship was relocated to the East Indies, where she joined the ABDA forces at the beginning of the war. From 1942, Tromp was part of the U.S. 7th Fleet and escorted transport vessels in the Indian Ocean and Australian waters. After that, the ship joined the British Far East Fleet and took part in a fleet review in honor of the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953.",

Following lengthy discussions on what the new ship class should look like, it was determined that the main requirement was high speed. If deemed necessary, the ship needed to have a chance to avoid fighting against stronger opponents, such as Japanese Kongō-class battlecruisers. According to the project, the cruiser's displacement was 16,000 tons; she could accelerate up to 32–33 knots and carry 203 mm guns on board. But the armor of such a ship was considered insufficient by the naval committee, and the project was never completed.",

At the beginning of the Civil War, a fight sparked off on board Almirante Cervera as the Republicans tried and failed to take the ship out of port, and the ship fell into the hands of Franco's side. The cruiser took part in the blockade of the coast, supported troop advances with covering fire, escorted convoys, and participated in the Battle of Cape Palos.",
